## Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands operates multiple five-star hotels across India, with two decades of industry presence. However, they are experiencing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category due to competition and management decisions. To address this, the managing director aims to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" but lacks an in-house data analytics team.

## Task List:

As a data analyst, my responsibilities include:

- Creating metrics based on the provided list.

- Designing a dashboard according to stakeholders' mock-up.

- Providing additional insights beyond the specified metric list and dashboard design.
